# C Instructions
A program is a set of instructions. Different instructions are used to achieve different tasks in a program.
## Type declaration instruction
This instruction is used to declare type of variables.It is must to declare variable before using it.

`int i=0;`

`char name;`
## Arithmetic Instruction
Arithmetic instruction contains variable name on the left hand side of = and constants connected using operators on right hand side of =.

*,/,-,+ are arithmetic operators.

= is the assignment operator.

Variables and constants together are called operands.

Arithmetic statement in C could be of three types.
* Integer mode arithmetic statement - In this statement, all operands are either integer variables or integer constants.
* Real mode arithmetic statement - In this statement, all operands are either real constants or real variables.
* Mixed mode arithmetic statement - In this statement, some operands are integers and some are real.
## Integer and Float Conversions
* An arithmetic operation between integers yields an integer.
* An operation between a real and real yields a real result.
* An operation between a real and an integer yields a real result. In this operation first integer is promoted to real and then operation is performed.
## Hierarchy of Operations
 ```
 Priority  Operators  Description

 1st       * / %      Multiplication, Division, Modular division
 
 2nd       + -        Addition, Subtraction
 
 3rd       =          Assignment
 
 ```
     
## Associativity of Operators
When an expression contains two operators of equal priority then associativity of operators is used.All operators in C either have Left to Right associativity or Right to Left associativity and they are used according to the expression.
## Control Instructions
Control instructions determine the flow of control in a program. They are :
* Sequence Control Instruction
* Selection or Decision Control Instruction
* Repetition or Loop Control Instruction
* Case Control Instruction
